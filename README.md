# TutorMap

TutorMap manages the tutoring schedule and tracks progress and income. This is a project

There was some hassle that I had to memo all things on my tutoring such as the rescheduled time, the deposit date, how many times I did it out of the total so far, and how much I earned. This project solved the problem.

### Live Demo

- It probably takes a longer time to load the first page because its server runs on Heroku free tier.
- Uploaded images are removed after a period of time because it doesn't use an external storage server, but Heroku free tier.
